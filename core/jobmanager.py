class JobManager:
    """Class responsible for jobs and files management.

    Every instance has the following attributes:

    *   ``foldername`` -- the working folder name.
    *   ``workdir`` -- the absolute path to the working folder.
    *   ``logfile`` -- the absolute path to the text logfile.
    *   ``job_logger`` -- the logger used to write job summaries.
    *   ``input`` -- the absolute path to the copy of the input file in the working folder.
    *   ``settings`` -- a |Settings| instance for this job manager (see below).
    *   ``jobs`` -- a list of all jobs managed with this instance (in order of |run| calls).
    *   ``names`` -- a dictionary with names of jobs. For each name an integer value is stored indicating how many jobs with that basename have already been run.
    *   ``hashes`` -- a dictionary working as a hash-table for jobs.

    The *path* argument should be a path to a directory inside which the main working folder will be created. If ``None``, the directory from where the whole script was executed is used.

    The ``foldername`` attribute is initially set to the *folder* argument. If such a folder already exists (and ``use_existing_folder`` is False), the suffix ``.002`` is appended to *folder* and the number is increased (``.003``, ``.004``...) until a non-existsing name is found. If *folder* is ``None``, the name ``plams_workdir`` is used, followed by the same procedure to find a unique ``foldername``.

    The ``settings`` attribute is directly set to the value of *settings* argument (unlike in other classes where they are copied) and it should be a |Settings| instance with the following keys:

    *   ``hashing`` -- chosen hashing method (see |RPM|).
    *   ``counter_len`` -- length of number appended to the job name in case of a name conflict.
    *   ``remove_empty_directories`` -- if ``True``, all empty subdirectories of the working folder are removed on |finish|.
